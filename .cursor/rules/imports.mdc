Do not import from files with any of the following names: index, node, bun, browser, common

Use import type whenever you are importing a type.

Prefer top-level `import type` over inline `import { type ... }` when there is only a type being imported

```ts
// BAD
import { type TUser } from "./user";
```

```ts
// GOOD
import type { TUser } from "./user";
```

When mixed, then keep to a single line:
```ts
// BAD
import { type TUser } from "./user";
import { User } from "./user";
```

```ts
// GOOD
import { User, type TUser } from "./user";
```

Merge the two lines when you get a chance.

If a type is being imported and there is not `type` keyword before it, then add it.
